            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Jodhpur is a city in the Thar Desert of the northwest Indian state of Rajasthan. Its 15th-century
                    Mehrangarh Fort is a former palace that’s now a museum, displaying weapons, paintings and elaborate
                    royal palanquins (sedan chairs). Set on on a rocky outcrop, the fort overlooks the walled city,
                    where many buildings are painted the city’s iconic shade of blue.</p>

                <h3>Mehrangarh Fort</h3>
                <p>Mehrangarh Fort covers an area of 1,200 acres (486 hectares) in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. The complex is
                    located on a hilltop around 122 metres above the surrounding plain, and was constructed circa
                    1459 by Rajput ruler Rao Jodha. Inside its boundaries there are several palaces known for their
                    intricate carvings and expansive courtyards, as well as a museum housing various relics. A winding
                    road leads to and from the city below. The imprints of the impact of cannonballs fired by attacking
                    armies of Jaipur can still be seen on the second gate. To the left of the fort is the chhatri of
                    Kirat Singh Soda, a soldier who fell on the spot defending Mehrangarh.

                    There are seven gates, which include Jayapol (meaning 'victory gate'), built by Maharaja Man Singh
                    to commemorate his victories over Jaipur and Bikaner armies. There is also a Fattehpol (also meaning
                    'victory gate'), which commemorates Maharaja Ajit Singhji victory over Mughals.</p>

                <h3>Umaid Bhawan Palace</h3>
                <p>The palace was built at a slow pace as its initial objective was to provide employment to the
                    famine-stricken farmers in the area. The foundation stone was laid in 1929. About 2,000 to 3,000
                    people were employed in its construction.Occupation of the palace by the Maharaja came after its
                    completion in 1943, and close to the period of Indian Independence. There was some criticism for
                    embarking on an expensive project but it had served the main purpose of helping the citizens of
                    Jodhpur to face the famine situation.The estimated cost of building the palace was Rs 11
                    million.When it opened in 1943 it was considered one of the largest royal residences in the
                    world.


                    Umaid Bhawan Palace as seen from Mehrangarh Fort
                    The site chosen for the palace was on a hill known as Chittar hill in the outer limits of
                    Jodhpur,after which the palace is also known,where no water supply was available nearby and
                    hardly any vegetation grew as hill slopes were rocky. The building material required was not close
                    by as sandstone quarries were at quite a distance. Since the Maharaja had the foresight to bring his
                    project to fruition, he built a railway line to the quarry site to transport the building material.
                    Donkeys were inducted to haul soil to the site. The sandstone transported by rail was dressed at the
                    site into large blocks with interlocking joints so that they could be laid without the use of
                    mortar.</p>

                <h3>Mandore Garden</h3>
                <p>Mandore Garden or The Ravana temple is a suburb Historical town located 9 km north of Jodhpur city,
                    in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The unique as it sounds india does have quite a few of them. The
                    place is known as the birthplace of Ravana's wife mandodari. The mudgal brahmins in jodhpur claim
                    descendence from him and another virsion also tells of how his wife mandodari belonged to manodore,
                    thus making him the proverbial son-in-law of the city.whatever the case might be, the majesty of his
                    structure is something you can't miss standing statesquely amongest the cenotapes of the mandore
                    garden.</p>

                <h3>Jaswant Thada</h3>
                <p>The Jaswant Thada is a cenotaph located in Jodhpur, in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It was built by
                    Maharaja Sardar Singh of Jodhpur State in 1899 in memory of his father, Maharaja Jaswant Singh
                    II,and serves as the cremation ground for the royal Rajput family of Marwar.

                    The cenotaph is built out of intricately carved sheets of marble. These sheets are extremely thin
                    and polished so that they emit a warm glow when illuminated by the Sun.

                    The cenotaph's grounds feature carved gazebos, a tiered garden, and a small lake. There are three
                    other cenotaphs in the grounds. The cenotaph of Maharaja Jaswant Singh displays portraits of the
                    rulers and Maharajas of Jodhpur.</p>

                <h2>Jaipur</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Jaipur is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state of Rajasthan. As of 2011, the city had
                    a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Jaipur is also
                    known as the Pink City, due to the dominant colour scheme of its buildings. It is located 268 km
                    from the national capital New Delhi. On 6 July 2019, UNESCO World Heritage Committee inscribed
                    Jaipur the "Pink City of India" among its World Heritage Sites.</p>
                <h3>Amer Fort</h3>
                <p>Amber Fort or Amer Fort is a fort located in Amber, Rajasthan, India. Amber is a town with an area of
                    4 square kilometres (1.5 sq mi) located 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, the capital of
                    Rajasthan. The town of Amber and the Amber Fort was built by Raja Alan Singh Meena 967 AD, later
                    ruled by kachawaha rajputs. Located high on a hill, it is the principal tourist attraction in
                    Jaipur. Amber Fort is known for its artistic style elements. With its large ramparts and
                    series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks Maota Lake, which is the main
                    source of water for the Amber Palace.

                    Mughal architecture greatly influenced the architectural style of several buildings of the
                    fort. Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out
                    on four levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the Diwan-e-Aam, or "Hall of Public Audience",
                    the Diwan-e-Khas, or "Hall of Private Audience", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai Mandir,
                    and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over a water
                    cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amber Fort is also popularly known as the Amber Palace. The
                    palace was the residence of the Rajput Maharajas and their families. At the entrance to the palace
                    near the fort's Ganesh Gate, there is a temple dedicated to Shila Devi, a goddess of the Chaitanya
                    cult, which was given to Raja Man Singh when he defeated the Raja of Jessore, Bengal in 1604.
                    (Jessore is now in Bangladesh). Raja Man Singh had twelve queens so he made twelve rooms,
                    one for each. Each room had a staircase connected to the king’s room but the queens were not to go
                    upstairs. Raja Jai Singh had only one queen so he built one room equal to three old queen’s rooms.

                    This palace, along with Jaigarh Fort, is located immediately above on the Cheel ka Teela (Hill of
                    Eagles) of the same Aravalli range of hills.</p>
                <h3>Hawa Mahal</h3>
                <p>Hawa Mahal (English translation: "The Palace of Winds" or "The Palace of Breeze") is a palace in
                    Jaipur, India approximately 300 kilometers from the capital city of Delhi. Built from red and pink
                    sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or
                    women's chambers.

                    The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai
                    Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur. He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal
                    that he built this grand and historical palace. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five floor
                    exterior is akin to honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate
                    latticework. The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe
                    everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to
                    obey the strict rules of "purdah", which forbade them from appearing in public without face
                    coverings. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through,
                    thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.Many
                    people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is
                    the back.</p>
                <h3>Jal Mahal</h3>
                <p>The Jal Mahal palace is an architectural showcase of the Rajput style of architecture (common in
                    Rajasthan) on a grand scale, from Mughal architecture. The building has a picturesque view of Man
                    Sagar Lake, but owing to its seclusion from land is equally the focus of a viewpoint from the Man
                    Sagar Dam on the eastern side of the lake in front of the backdrop of the surrounding Nahargarh
                    ("tiger-abode") hills. The palace, built in red sandstone, is a five-storied building, of which four
                    floors remain underwater when the lake is full and the top floor is exposed[citation needed]. One
                    rectangular Chhatri on the roof is of the Bengal type. The chhatris on the four corners are
                    octagonal. The palace had suffered subsidence in the past and also partial seepage (plasterwork and
                    wall damage equivalent to rising damp) because of waterlogging, which have been repaired under a
                    restoration project of the Government of Rajasthan.</p>
                <h3>Nahargarh Fort</h3>
                <p>Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in the Indian
                    state of Rajasthan. Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong defence
                    ring for the city. The fort was originally named Sudarshangarh, but it became known as Nahargarh,
                    which means 'abode of tigers'. The popular belief is that Nahar here stands for Nahar Singh
                    Bhomia, whose spirit haunted the place and obstructed construction of the fort. Nahar's spirit
                    was pacified by building a temple in his memory within the fort, which thus became known by his
                    name.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Udaipur , also known as the "City of Lakes", is a city in the state of Rajasthan, India. It is the
                    historic capital of the kingdom
                    of Mewar in the former Rajputana Agency. It was founded in 1559 by Udai Singh II of the Sisodia clan
                    of Rajput, when he shifted his capital from the city of Chittorgarh to Udaipur after Chittorgarh
                    was besieged by Akbar. It remained as the capital city till 1818 when it became a British princely
                    state, and thereafter the Mewar province became a part of Rajasthan when India gained
                    independence in 1947.

                    The city is located in the southernmost part of Rajasthan, near the Gujarat border. It is surrounded
                    by the Aravali Range, which separates it from the Thar Desert. It is around 660 km from Delhi and
                    approximately 800 km from Mumbai, placed almost in the middle of two major Indian metro cities.
                    Besides, connectivity with Gujarat ports provide Udaipur a strategic geographical advantage.
                    Udaipur is well connected with nearby cities and states by means of road, rail and air
                    transportation facilities. The city is served by the Maharana Pratap Airport. Common languages
                    spoken include Hindi, English and Rajasthani (Mewari).</p>
                <h3>City Palace</h3>
                <p>City Palace, Udaipur is a palace complex situated in the city of Udaipur in the Indian state of
                    Rajasthan. It was built over a period of nearly 400 years, with contributions from several rulers of
                    the Mewar dynasty. Its construction began in 1553, started by Maharana Udai Singh II of the Sisodia
                    Rajput family as he shifted his capital from the erstwhile Chittor to the new found city of
                    Udaipur. The palace is located on the east bank of Lake Pichola and has several palaces built
                    within its complex.

                    The City Palace in Udaipur was built in a flamboyant style and is considered the largest of its type
                    in the state of Rajasthan. It was built atop a hill, in a fusion of the Rajasthani and Mughal
                    architectural styles, providing a panoramic view of the city and its surroundings. Overlooking Lake
                    Pichola, several historic monuments like the Lake Palace, Jag Mandir, Jagdish Temple, Monsoon
                    Palace, and Neemach Mata temple, are all in the vicinity of the palace complex. Nestled within the
                    Aravali mountain range, these landmarks are associated in popular culture with the filming of the
                    1983 James Bond movie Octopussy.</p>
                <h3>Lake Pichola</h3>
                <p>Lake Pichola, situated in Udaipur city in the Indian state of Rajasthan, is an artificial fresh water
                    lake, created in the year 1362 AD, named after the nearby Picholi village. It is one of the
                    several contiguous lakes, and developed over the last few centuries in and around the famous Udaipur
                    city. The lakes around Udaipur were primarily created by building dams to meet the drinking water
                    and irrigation needs of the city and its neighborhood. Two islands, Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir are
                    located within Pichola Lake, and have been developed with several palaces to provide views of the
                    lake.

                    There are four islands on the lake:

                    1. Jag Niwas, where the Lake Palace is built.
                    2. Jag Mandir, with the palace of the same name.
                    3. Mohan Mandir, from where the king would watch the annual Gangaur festival celebration.

                    4. Arsi Vilas, small island which was an ammunition depot, but also a small palace. This one was
                    built
                    by one of the maharanas of Udaipur to enjoy the sunset on the lake. It is also a sanctuary catering
                    to a variety of birds, including tufted ducks, coots, egrets, terns, cormorants and kingfishers.
                    Three of the numerous lakes found in the vicinity of Udaipur which connect with the Pichola lake and
                    the Saroop Sagar Lake connected by an arched bridge built by Maharana Swaroop Singh (1842-1861)
                    which in turn connects to the Fateh Sagar Lake, the crystal watered lake in the midst of tree lined
                    hills and the smaller Arsi vilas.</p>
                <h3>Lake Palace</h3>
                <p>Lake Palace (formally known as Jag Niwas) is a former summer palace of the royal dynasty of Mewar,
                    now turned into a hotel. The Lake Palace is located on the island of Jag Niwas in Lake Pichola,
                    Udaipur, India, and its natural foundation spans 4 acres (16,000 m2).</p>
                <h3>Fateh Sagar Lake</h3>
                <p>Fateh Sagar Lake is situated in the city of Udaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is an
                    artificial lake named after Maharana Fateh Singh of Udaipur and Mewar, constructed north-west of
                    Udaipur, to the north of Lake Pichola in the 1680s.

                    It is one of the four lakes of the Udaipur city; the other three being: the Lake Pichola (within the
                    Udaipur town), Udai Sagar Lake, 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) to the east of Udaipur, and Dhebar Lake or
                    Jaisamand Lake, 52 km (32 mi) south east of Udaipur.

                    Within the confines of the Fatah Sagar Lake, there are three small islands; the largest of these is
                    the Nehru Park (4 km2 (1.5 sq mi) area), which is a popular tourist attraction, the second island
                    (0.06 km2 or 15 acres area) houses a public park with an impressive water-jet fountain, and the
                    third island (1.2 km2 area) is the address for the Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO). The Nehru park
                    is accessible by inboard motor boats. The blue waters of the lake and the backdrop of the green
                    mountains has given the soubriquet "the second Kashmir" to Udaipur .</p>
                <h3>The Jagdish Temple</h3>
                <p>The Jagdish Temple is raised on a tall terrace and was completed in 1651. It attaches a double-storey
                    Mandapa (hall) to a double-storey saandhara (with a covered ambulatory) sanctum. The mandapa has
                    another storey tucked within its pyramidal samavarna (bellroof) while the hollow clustered spire
                    over the sanctum contains two more, nonfunctional stories. To reach the main shrine, one must climb
                    32 marble steps, intercepted by a Brass image of Garuda in the end, being the mount (vahana) of God
                    Vishnu. Shri Jagdish Temple is the most beautiful example of Hindu Iconography, consisting of three
                    stories of hand carved stone, with a steeple nearly 79 feet high and is the largest temple of
                    Udaipur.</p>

                <h3>Saheliyon-ki-Bari</h3>
                <p>Saheliyon-ki-Bari (Courtyard or Garden of the Maidens) is a major garden and a popular tourist space
                    in Udaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It lies in the northern part of the city and has
                    fountains and kiosks, a lotus pool and marble elephants. It was built by Rana Sangram Singh. There
                    is also a small museum here which has a lot of information about Indian history.</p>
                <h3>Moti Magri</h3>
                <p>Moti Magri ("Pearl hill") is a hill in India. It overlooks the Fateh Sagar Lake in the city of
                    Udaipur, Rajasthan.

                    Atop the Moti Magri or Pearl Hill is the memorial of the Rajput hero Maharana Pratap, which has a
                    bronze statue of the Maharana astride his favourite horse "Chetak".</p>
